# Welcome to MSU AI club Workshops
This repository contains workshops previously hosted by the 
MSU AI club.

You can find details and resources for each individual workshop within the folders.

# Google Colab
The main content of most of the workshops are in Google Colab notebooks, which you can access through the browser. There's no need to download anything. To access these, you need to sign in with a Google account that is NOT your MSU email.

# Other Dependencies
Most notebooks have dependencies that are required for it to work correctly.
Each workshop folder has a file called `requirements.txt` which contains the
names of required dependencies.

You can install these dependencies like so:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Note that your terminal must be in the directory of the workshop you wish to work with,
and the `pip` command will not become available until you install python. 

It is recommended to use [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to ensure that these dependencies do not clutter your python install.
This step is optional, but highly recommended!
